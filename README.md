# WT-ex2 Develop a travel blog featuring different CSS implementation methods. Create an image
slider using CSS animations, implement a masonry layout for blog posts with varying heights,
and design a floating social sharing sidebar. Add a sticky table of contents for longer articles,
style blockquotes with custom borders and typography, and build a responsive footer with a
newsletter signup that validates input using CSS pseudo-classes.
